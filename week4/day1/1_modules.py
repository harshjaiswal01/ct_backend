#Modules in Python : Modules in Python are either pre-built toolboxes, or toolboxes
#we build ourselves and import into projects that need them

#Modules typically contain functions, variables and classes

#why?

#-- Efficiency : why build something, that already exists
#-- Organization: Keeping things tidy and separating your concerns into their own designated spots
#-- Reusability : Recyling your tools
