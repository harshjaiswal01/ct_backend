# 1. Product Review Analysis
# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to extract insights from product reviews by using string manipulation to categorize 
# and summarize customer feedback for a SaaS product.

# Task 1: Keyword Highlighter

# Write a program that searches through a series of product reviews for keywords such as 
# "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average". Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.
