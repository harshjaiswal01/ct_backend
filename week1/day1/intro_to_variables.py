#Intro to variables

#Variables are abstract storage locations we associate with a name

food = 'Butter Chicken'
name = 'Harshvardhan Jaiswal'

print(food)
print('My name is', name, "and I love", food)

#multiple assignment

first, middle, last = "Love", "Butter Chicken", "always"

print (middle)

print (first)

#Naming convention in Python

#Variables use: snake_case (lowercase, words are seperated by underscores)

favorite_food = "Butter chicken"
coding_temple = "A great place to learn!"

#Constant Variables (who's values will never change) (capital SNAKE_CASE)
NUM_PI = 3.14

print(NUM_PI)

#Dont start your variable with a number

#No symbols in a variable

#NO RESERVED WORDS

catch="Try"

print(catch)
